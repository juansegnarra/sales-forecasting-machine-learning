# 📈 Sales Forecasting for SMEs – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Business Problem

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often lack advanced analytical tools to anticipate future sales performance. 

This project develops a predictive model that estimates sales volume using transactional, geographic, and product-level business data. The objective is to provide a practical and scalable forecasting solution for commercial decision-making.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

The project follows a structured Machine Learning workflow:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation using regression metrics
6. Interpretation of results

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following regression models were implemented:

- Linear Regression
- (Add here other models you used: Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model performance was evaluated using:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score

## 📈 Key Insights

- Product category and geographic location significantly influence sales volume.
- Electronics and Furniture show higher average sales.
- Monthly patterns suggest potential seasonality.
- Profitability varies strongly across subcategories.

---

## 📌 Business Impact

This predictive model enables:

- Sales forecasting for operational planning
- Identification of high-performing product segments
- Revenue optimization strategies
- Data-driven commercial decisions

The solution can be adapted for real-world SME environments with additional historical and contextual data.
