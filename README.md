# 📈 Sales Forecasting for SMEs – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Business Problem

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often lack advanced analytical tools to anticipate future sales performance.

This project develops a predictive model that estimates sales volume using transactional, geographic, and product-level business data. The objective is to provide a practical and scalable forecasting solution for commercial decision-making.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

The project follows a structured Machine Learning workflow:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training  
5. Model evaluation using regression metrics  
6. Interpretation of results

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The following regression model was implemented:

- Linear Regression  

Model performance was evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score
